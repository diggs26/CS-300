    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The problem we were solving in the projects of this course are creating different data models and their usage within an application. The data models are the Binary Search Trees, Hash Tables, and Linked Lists. Using these data structures, we were meant to make a program to compile, sort, and display course information for the ABC University.
  
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I tried to approach the problems with a straightforward approach with each problem we were tasked with solving. The different data structures have their own weaknesses and strengths depending on the algorithm they are used for. Data structures are important to understand because they are needed to be able to have a full understanding of computer programming.
  
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  I used the Zybooks resources to overcame any challenges I faced. I think the biggest issue I faced was properly calling functions or variables within other functions. I feel like i managed to fix most of these issues but not all of them.
    
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  The work I did on this project has expanded my knowledge on these data structures. It also forced me to learn how to develop my pseudocode more efficiently. I also was reminded that using a flowchart can also be helpful in keeping track of how the code structure should flow.
  
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  This project gave me the chance to approach the problems in multiple different ways, which encouraged me to try and write a more flexible and efficient code. I feel like with more practice like this project I will be able to develop that skill even further.
